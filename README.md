## Overview

Blockchain technology has gained significant attention for its potential to revolutionize industries by providing transparent, secure, and decentralized data management solutions. This project serves as an educational tool to understand how blockchain works through practical implementation.

## Features

- **Block Structure**: Each block contains an index, timestamp, data, previous hash, and a nonce.
- **Hashing**: Blocks are linked using cryptographic hashing (SHA-256).
- **Proof of Work**: Implements a basic proof of work algorithm for block mining.
- **Web Interface**: Includes a Flask-based web interface to interact with the blockchain (mine new blocks, view the chain).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chinnanj666/blockchain-project.git
   cd blockchain-python
2. **Install dependencies**:
    Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Install Flask if not already installed:
    ```bash
    pip install flask

3. **Run the blockchain**:
    Start the Flask server to run the blockchain: python3 your_python_filename.py, in mycase app.py
    ```bash
     python app.py
    ```
    The server will start on http://127.0.0.1:5000/mine.
## Usage

1. **Mining a New Block**:
   ```bash
    Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/mine to mine a new block.

2. **Viewing the Blockchain**:
   ```bash
    Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/chain to view the current state of the blockchain.
